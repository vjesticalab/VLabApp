`smp01_BF.ome.tif` and `smp01_WL450.ome.tif`:
Sample bright-field image (`smp01_BF.ome.tif`) and nuclear marker fluorescent image (`smp01_WL450.ome.tif`) of yeast cells acquired using an epifluorescence Nikon Ti2 system. Original images were cropped and converted to 8-bit ome.tif to reduce file size.



`cellpose_BF_yeast`:
Cellpose model obtained by fine-tuning cyto2 built-in model on bright-field images of yeast cells (Z-section with best focus).
