# File organization

This module can be used to export (move or copy) or remove chosen file types generated with VLabApp.


## Input files

A list of folders containing files generated with VLabApp.

To populate the list, use the <kbd>Add folder</kbd> and <kbd>Remove selected</kbd> buttons to add folder to the list or remove folder from the list. Alternatively, folders can be dragged and dropped from an external file manager.

When adding folders, only folders satisfying all filters (click on `â–¶` above the list to show filters) are added to the list.  By default, all folders are accepted.


## Parameters

Output folder
: Either use each input folder as output folder or specify a
custom output folder (in both cases, the ouput will be saved in a sub-folder with same basename as input folder). 
To select a custom folder, either paste the path
into the text box, click on the <kbd>Browse</kbd> button, or drag and drop a
folder from an external file manager.

File selection:
: select the type of files to export/remove.


Click on the <kbd>Copy files</kbd> or <kbd>Move files</kbd> button to copy or move selected files from the input folder to the output folder, or click on the <kbd>Remove files</kbd> button to remove selected files from the input folder.
