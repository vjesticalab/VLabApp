# File naming conventions and supported formats

VLabApp is based on the following workflow: for each analysis,  a copy of (or a symbolic link to) the image to analyze is placed in a working directory. This copy (or link) is used as input to VLabApp. By default, all outputs generated by VLabApp will be created into the directory containing the input file, with filenames generated by adding suffixes to the input filename.


## File naming

Each input image filename should start with a unique identifier, which is the part of the filename before the first `_`. Within a working directory, files with same unique identifier are assumed to correspond to the same image. This property is used to match files (e.g. to associate a registration matrix to an image).

For example, all the following files have the same unique identifier (`smp02-s03`):
```
smp02-s03.nd2
smp02-s03_BF.nd2
smp02-s03_WL508.nd2
smp02-s03_BF_vRG.csv
smp02-s03_BF_vRG.ome.tif
```

Multidimensional images used as input can be very large. To limit the size of individual files, it is common to split an image into multiple images, each containing a unique channel. Although not mandatory, it is recommended to append a `_BF` suffix to images with a unique bright-field channel and `_WL<w>` to images with a unique fluorescence channel with emission wavelength `<w>`. For example:
```
smp02-s03_BF.nd2
smp02-s03_WL508.nd2
smp02-s03_WL614.nd2
```

By default, VLabApp output files are saved in the working directory containing the input file, with a filename generated by adding a suffix to input filename. The following suffixes are used in VLabApp:

`_vRG`
: Output of registration module.
    
    Examples:
    
    * `smp01_vRG.csv`
    * `smp02_vRG.ome.tif`


`_vPR<ref><range><proj>`
: Output of projection module, where `<ref>` is the reference Z-section (`b` for best focus or `f` for fixed range), `<range>` is the range of Z-sections (one integer for range around Z-section with best focus or two integers  min and max separated by a `-` for fixed Z-section range) and `<proj>` is the projection type (`none`, `max`, `min`, `mean`, `median` or `std`).
    
    Examples:
    
    * `smp03_vPRf3-7max.ome.tif` (maximum projection of all Z sections with $3\le Z\le 7$)
    * `smp01_vRG_vPRb3mean.ome.tif` (mean projection of all Z sections with $Z$ in the interval $[Z_{best}-3,Z_{best}+3]$, where $Z_{best}$ is the Z section with best focus)
    * `smp04_vPRb0none.ome.tif` (Z-section with best focus)


`_vSM`
: Output of segmentation module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp02_vSM.ome.tif`
    *  `smp04_vPRb3mean_vSM.ome.tif`


`_vTG`
: Output of cell tracking module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp02_vSM_vTG.ome.tif`
    *  `smp02_vSM_vTG.graphmlz`


`_vGF`
: Output of graph filtering module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp04_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vGF.ome.tif`
    *  `smp04_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vGF.graphmlz`

`_vEF`
: Output of events filter module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp01_vRG_vSM_vTG_vEF.ome.tif`
    *  `smp01_vRG_vSM_vTG_vEF.graphmlz`
  
`_vCR`
: Output of image cropping module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp03_vCR.ome.tif`
    *  `smp05_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vTG_vCR.ome.tif`
  
`_vGT`
: Output of ground truth generator module.
    
    Examples:
    
    *  `smp02_vGT.ome.tif`
    *  `smp04_vCR_vRG_vGT.ome.tif`


Notes:
* All suffixes (except `_vPR`) can be followed by a user defined string using any of the `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9` and `-` characters.




## File formats

### Images and masks

Images and masks are multi-dimensional arrays with up to 5 dimensions. Depending on the module used, images and masks can have `T` (time), `C` (channel), `Z` (Z-section), `Y` and `X` axes.

Masks should have the same dimension as the corresponding image (except for `C` axis) with a unique channel containing an integer mask ID (or label ID). All pixels assigned to the same segmented object should have the same ID integer value, while background pixels should have ID 0.


**Input formats:**

* Nikon NIS Elements format (`.nd2`).
* [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) OME-TIFF format (`.ome.tif` or `.ome.tiff`).
* TIFF tagged image file format (`.tif` or `.tiff`).

**Output format:**

* [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) OME-TIFF format (`.ome.tif` or `.ome.tiff`) with 16-bit unsigned integer values.


**Export formats:**

* MP4 video (`.mp4`).
* JPEG image (`.jpg`).
* [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) ROI set (`.zip`). Only for masks, with ROIs named as `<cell track id>_<time frame>_<mask id>`.


### Cell tracking graphs

Cell tracking graphs encode the time evolution of the segmentation masks, with vertices corresponding to segmented objects (usually cells) at a given time frame, and edges corresponding to overlap between segmented objects across time frames (see [Cell tracking module - Appendix: Cell tracking method](../cell_tracking_module/reference.md#appendix-cell-tracking-method) for more information). Connected components of the graph are called *cell tracks*.

**Input format:**

* gzipped [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) files created with VLabApp (`.graphmlz`).

**Output format:**

* gzipped [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) files (`.graphmlz`).

**Export formats:**

* List of edges (`.tsv`) in tab-separated values format, with header in first row and the following columns:

    * `id1`: source vertex id (correspond to the ImageJ ROI name `<cell_track_id>_<frame1>_<mask_id1>`).
    * `frame1`: source vertex time frame.
    * `mask_id1`: source vertex mask ID.
    * `area1`: source vertex area (number of pixels).
    * `id2`: target vertex id (correspond to the ImageJ ROI name `<cell_track_id>_<frame2>_<mask_id2>`).
    * `frame2`: target vertex time frame.
    * `mask_id2`: target vertex mask ID.
    * `area2`: target vertex area (number of pixels).
    * `overlap_area`: overlap between source and target vertices (number of pixels).
    * `cell_track_id`: cell track ID.
    
    Isolated vertices appear in the list with target vertex and edge properties set to `nan`.

* [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) dot format (`.dot`), with vertices named as `<cell track id>_<time frame>_<mask id>`. The  [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) `dot` tool can be used to generate a pdf file (e.g. `smp02_vSM_vTG.pdf`) with a graphical representation of the cell tracking graph (e.g. `smp02_vSM_vTG.dot`) with time flowing from top to bottom:

    ```
    dot -Tpdf smp02_vSM_vTG.pdf smp02_vSM_vTG.dot
    ```

* [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) (`.graphml`), with vertices named as `<cell track id>_<time frame>_<mask id>`, the following vertices attributes:

    * `frame`: vertex time frame.
    * `mask_id`: vertex mask ID.
    * `area`: vertex area (number of pixels).
    * `cell_track`: cell track ID.
    
    and edge attribute:
    
    * `overlap_area`:  overlap between source and target vertices (number of pixels).


### Transformation matrices (registration)

Transformation matrices are generated the registration module and encode the shift between consecutive time frames for all time frames, as well as the range of time frames which should be taken into account when applying the transformation.

**Input/output format:**

* comma-separated values format (`.csv`), with optional metadata rows (starting with `#`) followed a header and the following columns:

    * `timePoint`: time frame (1-based indexing!)
    * `align_t_x`: shift along X (pixels) axis since first kept time frame (i.e. first time frame with column `align_0_1` set to 1).
    * `align_t_y`: shift along Y (pixels) axis since first kept time frame (i.e. first time frame with column `align_0_1` set to 1).
    * `align_0_1`: keep (1) or discard (0) time frame when applying the transformation.
    * `raw_t_x`: shift along X axis (pixels) since first time frame.
    * `raw_t_y`: shift along Y axis (pixels) since first time frame.
    * `x`: image width (pixels).
    * `y`: image height (pixels).


## Log files and metadata

When using a module, system information (platform, python version, modules versions) as well as the operations applied along with the main parameters are  written to a log file (with same base name as the output files) and added to the metadata of the output file. The metadata from all input files are also added to the metadata of the output file, with latest metadata appearing first.

Use the "View metadata" module to view metadata (see [View metadata](../viewer_metadata_module/reference.md) for more information).


For example, when using the cell tracking module to  create a mask and cell tracking graph with filenames
```
smp01_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vGF.ome.tif
smp01_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vGF.graphmlz
```
a log file will be created with filename
```
smp01_vRG_vPRb3mean_vSM_vTG_vGF.log
```
and content:
```
